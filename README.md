An attempt to create a simple neural network from scratch as a training. 

It worked, tested on a simple case and failed on a classification of indoor/ outdoor pictures 
(dataset from https://huggingface.co/datasets/prithivMLmods/IndoorOutdoorNet-20K?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
due to it being a primitive algorithm with almost none regularization and me running it on a macbook.
